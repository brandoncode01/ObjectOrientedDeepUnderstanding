# Main Concepts
Staring with object oriented paradigm could be hard before start
using this parading you must understand some concepts

## Class
Class is one of the most important concepts in Object-Oriented,
there are many different definitions on the internet about class.
In simple terms a class **is a blueprint** for creating **objects**.

Some examples of classes are

* Animal
* Vehicle
* Plants
* Book

Each class contains **properties**  or **attributes** that characterize
or differentiates from other classes. We can notice this attributes 
in the file named **[Classes.java](Classes.java)** located in this same package.

### Why we need classes?
One of the main of why we need classes is due many reasons such as
**Encapsulation**, **Code Reuse**, **Abstractions** and many more.
You will understand this as you keep learning OO.

You can see how attributes would look like if we don't use Objected-Oriented in
file **[NoClass.java](NoClasses.java)**


Of course there are betters other ways to create attributes such as
encapsulate properties within functions but this approach is not recommend.

We can notice that by using encapsulation we relate attributes to classes, this allows us
to make the code more clean and scalable in terms of separating code, reuse code, and encapsulation.
